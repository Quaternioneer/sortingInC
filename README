Version 0: Compiles, but there is run-timer error where 1 and 0 are out of order. And on the second run (without recompiling in between), the number 9 is also replaced with another 0.

Version 0.1: I changed the array indices form 1 to n to 0 to n-1. As I understand it, C's arrays have always spanned 0 to N-1, so I don't understand why it was written starting at 1. Howver, in the comments it does say, "Sorts an array arr[1..n]". I knew that C++ started at 0, but this is my one of first C programs.
